# Question: How do you implement a function to find the Nth node from the end in a singly linked list? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided defines two classes: Node and LinkedList. The Node class is used to create new nodes for the linked list, each with a data value and a reference to the next node. The LinkedList class is used to create a new linked list, with methods to insert new nodes at the end of the list and to find the Nth node from the end of the list. The method to find the Nth node from the end, `getNthNodeFromEnd`, uses two pointers to traverse the list. Initially, both pointers point to the head of the list. The reference pointer (`refPtr`) moves ahead by N nodes first. If the list has fewer than N nodes, a message is logged to the console. If the list has at least N nodes, the main pointer (`mainPtr`) and the reference pointer start moving together towards the end of the list. When the reference pointer reaches the end, the main pointer is at the Nth node from the end of the list. The data of this node is then logged to the console. The code also includes a test case where nodes with data 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 are inserted into the list, and the 3rd node from the end is found.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of the overall logic and approach to solve the problem. Both versions use two pointers to traverse the linked list and find the Nth node from the end. However, there are a few differences due to the features and syntax of TypeScript:

1. Type Annotations: TypeScript version uses type annotations to specify the type of variables and function return values. For example, `data: number`, `next: Node | null`, `head: Node | null`, `insertAtEnd(data: number): void`, and `findNthFromEnd(n: number): Node | null`. This provides better type safety and can help prevent potential type-related bugs.

2. Non-null Assertion Operator: The TypeScript version uses the non-null assertion operator (`!`) in `firstPointer = firstPointer!.next;`. This tells TypeScript that `firstPointer` will not be `null` or `undefined` at this point, which can be useful when TypeScript's strict null checking is enabled.

3. Error Handling: The JavaScript version prints an error message to the console if `n` is greater than the number of nodes in the list. The TypeScript version, on the other hand, returns `null` in this case. This allows the calling code to handle the error in a way that's appropriate for its needs.

4. Method Naming: The method to find the Nth node from the end is named `getNthNodeFromEnd` in the JavaScript version and `findNthFromEnd` in the TypeScript version. This is a minor difference and doesn't affect how the problem is solved.

5. The TypeScript version does not modify the head of the linked list if `n` is greater than the number of nodes in the list, unlike the JavaScript version. This is a more correct behavior because the problem statement does not ask for the list to be modified.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution is similar to the JavaScript version in terms of logic. Both versions use two pointers to traverse the linked list and find the Nth node from the end. However, there are some differences due to the language features and syntax of C++ and JavaScript.

1. Class and Struct: In JavaScript, the linked list and its nodes are defined using classes (`Node` and `LinkedList`). In C++, the node is defined using a struct (`Node`), and the linked list is not encapsulated in a class or struct. Instead, the head of the list is passed as an argument to the functions that manipulate the list.

2. Memory Allocation: In JavaScript, memory allocation for new objects is handled automatically. In C++, memory for new nodes is allocated using the `new` keyword, and it's necessary to check if the memory allocation was successful.

3. Null and NULL: In JavaScript, the null value is represented by `null`. In C++, it's represented by `NULL`.

4. Error Handling: In the JavaScript version, if `n` is greater than the number of nodes in the list, a message is logged to the console. In the C++ version, if `n` is less than 1 or greater than the number of nodes, the `findNthFromEnd` function returns `NULL`.

5. Function Return Values: The JavaScript version logs the data of the Nth node from the end to the console. The C++ version returns a pointer to the Nth node from the end, and the data of the node is printed in the `main` function.

6. Insertion Method: In JavaScript, the `insertAtEnd` method is a part of the `LinkedList` class and manipulates the `head` property of the class. In C++, `insertNode` is a standalone function that takes the head of the list as a parameter and returns the new head of the list.

7. Main Function: In JavaScript, the linked list is manipulated in the global scope. In C++, the linked list is manipulated in the `main` function, which is the entry point of the program.
